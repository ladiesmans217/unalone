# Services Directory

This directory contains all service classes and API communication logic.

## Structure:
- **API Services**: HTTP requests and backend communication
- **Storage Services**: Local storage and caching
- **Location Services**: GPS and location-based functionality
- **Auth Services**: Authentication and token management

## Naming Convention:
- Use PascalCase with "Service" suffix (e.g., `AuthService.ts`)
- Keep services focused on single responsibility
- Export service instances for use throughout the app
